    ob_start();
    print "Hello Third!\n";

That script will output "Hello First" because the first text is placed into a buffer then flushed with ob_end_flush(). The "Hello Second" will not be printed out, though, because it is placed into a buffer which is cleaned using ob_end_clean() and not sent to output. Finally, the script will print out "Hello Third" because PHP automatically flushes open output buffers when it reaches the end of a script. -->
