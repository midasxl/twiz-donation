	buy me a coffee tag
-----

faq
	scrub through and advertise the free/donation-based biz model
	add the logic to move page to top of current accordion that is open

-----

registration
	change "premium content at an affordable price"

need to have description of why we still require users to register (to keep track of their sheets)

-----

account page
	users must be able to run sheets at will, not dependent on credits
	need to eliminate a few of the member levels (quickie, subscription, base, admin)
	quickie and subscription member levels are no longer necessary.  Just base and admin level

-----

There is a lot of "behind-the-scenes" logic to clean up 
	stripe transactions
	twiz sheet credit checks
	database tables (remove user_credits table, remove pay_status, trial, plan_id, stripe_id from users table)

	pages that reference stripe and/or credits
		account.php (credit check and stripe purchase options)
		admin_user.php (credit check)
		single-access.php (credit check and quick role check)
		single-product.php (credit check for decrementing; checks for quickie role)
		user-profile.php (credit check and stripe config)
		user_cancel_subscription.php
		user_charge.php
		user_charge_package_10.php
		user_charge_subscription.php
		scripts/stripe/* (do not need)
		scripts/user-login.php (looks for stripe id and stripe plan)
		models/class.newuser.php (new user database insert includes stripe_id and plan_id (remove from db table as well), inserts default credit tally in the user_credits table)
		models/class.user.php (stripe_id and plan_id are used; public function checkCredits() is in here)
		models/funcs.php
			line 430 deleteUsers references user_credits table
			line 696 fetchUserDetails gets stripe_id and plan_id from the users table

			line 1136 fetchStripeId gets stripe_id from users table
			line 1174 fetchPlanId gets plan_id from users table
			line 1418 validatePayStatus sets pay_status in users table (what is this?)

			line 1787 fetchAllCredits gets credit information from the user_credits table
